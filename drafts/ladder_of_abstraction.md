I might not be the best writer, but that doesn't mean I have a couple tricks under my sleeve.

A year ago, while at the Kennedy School, I took an amazing writing class with Professor Alex Marzano-Lesnevich. There I learned an old concept called **the ladder of abstraction**.

The ladder of abstraction is used to classify how abstract or concrete are your sentences. For example in [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/opinion/tsa-transgender.html) we can find sentences that have a higher level of abstraction:

> The analysis suggested what many of us in the transgender community already know: young people become more comfortable with trusting their own self-expression and bodies rather than a socially constructed and enforced idea of a strict binary, the number of transgender people in society will grow.

And sentences that are more concrete:

> But I am more often called “ma’am.” I have a soft jawline and curved hips.

In the class I had two main takeaways about how to use the ladder of abstraction[^sorry-prof]:

1.  Successful writing usually **goes up and down the ladder of abstraction**.
2.  When in doubt use more concrete levels of abstraction.





**Bonus:** A motivating read to improve your writing is Orwell's [Politics and the English Language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit). The summary are his rules:

> - Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> - Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> - If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> - Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> - Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> - Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

    Sorry Alex if I misunderstood your teaching!
