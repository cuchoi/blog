I'am a Data Science Manager at Enveritas, a YCombinator nonprofit working to end global poverty in the coffee sector by 2030.

I like programming in Python, applying statistics to interesting problems, and using economic intuition to understand behaviours.  Other things that I enjoy: walking my dog (yes, [he has Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kei_shibainu/)[^1]) in the Central Park, self-deprecating humor, museums, and Opera (a recent addition to the list).

Previously I worked for the MIT Poverty Action Lab, was a consultant for the World Bank, did some Software Engineering, and received a MPA/ID from Harvard.
